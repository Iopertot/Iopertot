Loper

Not that good at coding as I am still learning and have this as a hobby
I do not work professionally.

I have been programming for close to 8 years but dont use github so I apologise if there is months with no activity as I am not used to using this and tend to forget until someone reminds me and I mass upload.

I mostly do web development and cryptography but dabble in backend development and gamedev.
